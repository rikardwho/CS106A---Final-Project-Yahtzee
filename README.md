# CS106A---Final-Project-Yahtzee

This is my final project for the Stanford University CS106A, Code In Place.

It is a Yahtzee game in progress. It still needs some functionality, like:
  - hard limits on dice throws
  - making it turn based
  - fixing the odd pixel here and there
  - startpage
  - settings
